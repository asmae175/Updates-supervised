TO UPDATE THE SIMULATOR TO RUN SUPERVISED LEARNING:
 - Replace bindsnet/Two-layer-Network with Two-layer-Network in this compressed directory.
 - Replace bindsnet/bindsnet/models , bindsnet/bindsnet/network, bindsnet/bindsnet/learning and bindsnet/bindsnet/utils  with the content of bindsnet repository in this compressed directory.

Content:
 - Two-layer-Network/Spervised_2_layer.py implements supervised learning with the two-layer network
 - Two-layer-Network/Spervised_3_layer.py implements supervised learning with the three-layer network
 - Two-layer-Network/Two-layer-Network-MNIST implements unsupervised learning with the two-layer network
 - Two-layer-Network/Three-layer-Network-MNIST implements unsupervised learning with the Three-layer network
